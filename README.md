# Kafka-Setup-and-Message-Streaming-with-Docker
This project demonstrates the setup of a Kafka environment using Docker, creation of a Kafka topic, and implementation of a producer and consumer. The producer sends messages to the Kafka broker, and the consumer receives these messages, showcasing the basic functionality of Apache Kafka for message streaming.
